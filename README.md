# üè¢ Yerevan Apartment Price Prediction

This project predicts apartment prices in Yerevan based on features such as total area, number of rooms, building type, renovation type, district, and more.  
I developed this project using machine learning techniques (Neural Networks with Keras) and a custom-trained model.
