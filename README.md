# üè¢ Yerevan Apartment Price Prediction

This project predicts apartment prices in Yerevan based on features such as total area, number of rooms, building type, renovation type, district, and more.  
I developed this project using machine learning techniques (Neural Networks with Keras).

## **Project Structure**
- **Data/** ‚Äì Raw and processed datasets.
- **Models/** ‚Äì Trained model and preprocessing objects (`.keras` and `.pkl` files).
- **Notebooks/** ‚Äì Data visualization, exploration, and experiments.
- **Scr/Data_processing/** ‚Äì Scripts for cleaning and preparing the dataset.
- **Scr/GUI/** ‚Äì Tkinter-based graphical interface for price prediction.
- **predict_model.py** ‚Äì Script to load the trained model and predict prices.
- **train_model.py** ‚Äì Script to train the neural network model.

## **Features**
- Predicts apartment prices in USD.
- Cleans and preprocesses raw data (translations, filtering, and conversions).
- Provides various data visualizations (price distribution, heatmaps, scatter plots).
- Interactive **Tkinter GUI** for easy price prediction.
- GUI is available in **English**.
- Model evaluation with metrics like **MAE, RMSE, and R¬≤**.
- Includes **Real vs Predicted Prices** plot for visual model evaluation.

## **Installation**
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PetrosyanHaykk/Yerevan-Flat-Price-Prediction.git
   cd Yerevan-Flat-Price-Prediction

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    # On Windows
    py -m venv venv    
    ./venv/Scripts/activate
    
    # On Linux/Mac
    python3 -m venv venv    
    source venv/bin/activate
3. **Install required libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt

4. **How to use the project:**
   ```bash
   # Run the prediction script
   python Scr/predict_model.py

   # Train the model
   python Scr/train_model.py

   # Launch the GUI for price prediction
   python Scr/GUI/app.py



   #You need to use Jupyter Notebook to open and run data_processing and  data_visualisation files:
   
   bash
   jupyter notebook Notebooks/data_processing.ipynb
   jupyter notebook Notebooks/data_visualisation.ipynb


   #If you want to run them from VS Code, install the Jupyter extension and make sure you have Jupyter installed:

   bash
   pip install notebook jupyterlab


**Important: TensorFlow and Python Version Compatibility:**

    TensorFlow is very sensitive to the Python version you use.
    If you install TensorFlow on a Python version that is not supported, you will get errors like:

    ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement tensorflow

    To avoid these issues, use one of the compatible Python versions for TensorFlow:
    Recommended: Python 3.9, 3.10, or 3.11 (fully supported by TensorFlow 2.16+).
    Older versions of TensorFlow also work with Python 3.8 (but not newer than 3.11).

    If you have Python 3.12 or newer, install Python 3.11 instead:

    then 

    py -3.11 -m venv venv
    ./venv/Scripts/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
